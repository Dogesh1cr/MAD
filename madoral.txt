Flutter Concepts

1. What is Dart and how is it used in Flutter?
Dart is a client-optimized programming language developed by Google. Flutter uses Dart to build UI and manage state.


2. What are the main features of Flutter?

Hot reload

Cross-platform development

Rich set of widgets

Fast performance

Open-source



3. What is the widget tree in Flutter?
It’s the hierarchy of widgets used to build the UI. The UI is a tree of nested widgets.


4. Difference between StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget?

StatelessWidget: UI doesn’t change during runtime.

StatefulWidget: UI can change using setState().



5. How does hot reload work in Flutter?
It injects updated code into a running app without restarting it, preserving state and speeding up development.

Flutter Widgets & UI

6. Commonly used layout widgets?

Container, Row, Column, Expanded, Padding, Stack, SizedBox



7. Use of Scaffold and AppBar?

Scaffold: Provides a default structure for the app screen (like layout, FAB, drawer).

AppBar: Provides a material design header for the app.



8. How do you handle user input in Flutter?
Using widgets like TextField, TextFormField, and managing input with controllers and validators.


9. What are Expanded and Flexible used for?
They control how child widgets grow and occupy available space in Row or Column.


10. Explain the lifecycle of a Flutter widget.



For StatefulWidget: initState() → build() → setState() → dispose()



---

Navigation

11. Named vs unnamed routes?



Named: Defined in route table and navigated using route name.

Unnamed: Directly use Navigator.push() with a widget.


12. Pass data between screens?
Use constructor arguments or pass data through Navigator.push() with route settings.




---

Firebase Integration

13. What services does Firebase provide?



Firestore, Authentication, Hosting, Cloud Storage, Realtime DB, Analytics, etc.


14. Read/write in Firestore:



Read: FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('users').get()

Write: .add() or .set() methods


15. Difference between Realtime DB and Firestore?



Realtime DB: JSON tree, less structured

Firestore: Document-based, more scalable and structured


16. Authenticate users in Flutter using Firebase?
Use firebase_auth package and methods like signInWithEmailAndPassword() or signInWithGoogle().

PWA Questions

17. What makes a web app progressive?
Features like offline access, push notifications, installability, and responsive design.


18. Difference between web app and PWA?



PWA works offline, can be installed, uses service workers

Web app needs internet, runs in browser only


19. How do PWAs work offline?
They cache resources using service workers so users can access the app without the internet.


20. Role of manifest.json?
It defines app name, icons, theme, and installability options for PWAs.


21. Ensure installable PWA?
Provide a valid manifest.json and register a service worker with HTTPS hosting.


22. Push notifications in PWA?
Use service workers to listen for push events and display them using the showNotification() method.




---

Service Workers

23. Lifecycle phases of a service worker?



Install

Activate

Fetch (intercepts network requests)


24. Caching in service workers?
Use caches.open() to store assets and serve them from cache instead of the network.


25. Cache-first vs network-first?



Cache-first: Try cache first, then network

Network-first: Try network first, fallback to cache if offline



---

Responsive UI/Frontend Frameworks

26. What is Material Design?
A design system by Google that provides guidelines and components for visually consistent apps.


27. Benefits of Angular/React?



Component-based architecture

Fast rendering

Reusability

Large community support


28. Ensure responsive app?
Use MediaQuery, Flexible, LayoutBuilder, and percentage-based dimensions.


29. Difference between MediaQuery and LayoutBuilder?



MediaQuery: Gets screen size and orientation

LayoutBuilder: Measures the space available to a widget



---

Deployment and Hosting

30. Deploy Flutter web app?
Build with flutter build web and host build/web on Firebase Hosting or GitHub Pages.


31. What is static hosting? Examples?
Serving fixed files (HTML, CSS, JS).
Examples: GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting, Netlify


32. Why is SSL important in PWA?
Service workers and push notifications require HTTPS for security.
